Boxplot is probably the most commonly used chart type to compare distribution of several groups. 
However, you should keep in mind that data distribution is hidden behind each box. 
For instance, a normal distribution could look exactly the same as a bimodal distribution.
Please read more explanation on this matter, and consider a violin plot or a ridgline chart instead.
